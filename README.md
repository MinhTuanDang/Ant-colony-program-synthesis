# Ant-colony-program-synthesis
Building an automatic programming script based on the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm- a swarm-based intelligent technique.

Automatic programming or program synthesis allows the programmer to avoid the tedious task of creating a program to solve a well-deﬁned problem. Automatic programming is the speciﬁcation of goals that are to be realized by the program and it is based on this speciﬁcation that the program is constructed automatically.

Evolutionary algorithms and genetic algorithms are quite familiar techniques to handle this problem. In this repository, I applied Ant Colony Algorithm- which is one of the most famous algorithm in these techniques to perform symbolic regression- a novel form of program synthesis/automatic programming.
